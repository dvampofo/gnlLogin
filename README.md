# TEAM MAYDE'S GNL Prototype: Redux Contact List

## DESCRIPTION

![Image summary](https://github.com/dvampofo/gnlLogin/blob/master/images/imagesummary.jpg?raw=true)

This is a customized login page made for Team MAYDE Globally Networked Learning (GNL) Prototype. The prototype objective is to facilitate communication between individuals securely across the world. Specifically, the purpose is to expand high school, university student and their parents perspective about about studying and living abroad. A digital space is created where students can securely communicate (via OpenPGP) by text and video with university students studying abroad, sharXe and store files. If the student no longer wishes to be part of the room, they can leave it and have the stored data permanently destroyed (using the Data Shredder program).

## GNL'S PENPAL SUMMARY

The objective of this activity is to create conversation between students in different countries. Students are assigned pen pals in another country but rather than writing to them they film vlogs of their experiences studying abroad. The activity is designed for students who are on exchange, they can send back their videos/pictures to their home institution or to students who on exchange at their home institution. But it can be used by students who are curious of being a student in another country or by institutions wanting to promote their school abroad.
