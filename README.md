# TEAM MAYDE GNL Prototype: Redux Contact List

## DESCRIPTION

![Image summary](https://github.com/dvampofo/gnlLogin/blob/master/images/imagesummary.jpg?raw=true)

This is a customized login page made for Team MAYDE Globally Networked Learning (GNL) Prototype. The prototype objective is to facilitate communication between individuals securely across the world. Specifically, the purpose is to expand high school, university student and their parents perspective about about studying and living abroad. A digital space is created where students can securely communicate (via OpenPGP) by text and video with university students studying abroad, share and store files. If the student no longer wishes to be part of the room, they can leave it and have the stored data permanently destroyed (using the Data Shredder program).
